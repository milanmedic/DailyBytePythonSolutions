# This question is asked by Google. Given a string of digits, return all possible text messages those digits could send. Note: The mapping of digits to letters is as followsâ€¦

# 0 -> null
# 1 -> null
# 2 -> "abc"
# 3 -> "def"
# 4 -> "ghi"
# 5 -> "jkl"
# 6 -> "mno"
# 7 -> "pqrs"
# 8 -> "tuv"
# 9 -> "wxyz"

# Ex: digits = "23" return ["ad", "ae", "af", "bd", "be", "bf", "cd", "ce", "cf"]

# current solution is O(n^3) which is terribly inefficient. Go thorugh an algorithms course
